Contributing Guidelines
=======================

To learn more about the purpose of SEPs and how to go about writing a SEP, please
start reading at SEP 1 (`sep-0001.rst <./sep-0001.rst>`_ in this repo).


Before writing a new SEP
------------------------

Has this idea been proposed on `SD Development`_ or `SD Governance`_
and received general acceptance as being an idea worth pursuing? (if not then
please start a discussion there before submitting a pull request).

More details about it in `SEP 1 <./sep-0001.rst#start-with-an-idea-for-space-decentral>`_
and `submitting a sep <./sep-0001.rst#submitting-a-sep>`_.

Do you have an implementation of your idea? (this is important for when you
propose this SEP to `SD Development`_ or `SD Governance`_
as code and content maintenance is a critical aspect of all SEP proposals prior to a
final decision; in special circumstances an implementation can be deferred)

Once you've read the guidelines for submitting a sep, you may `Submit a pull request`_


Submit a pull request
---------------------

1. Fork this repo, e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/seps/fork
2. Create a branch that follows the naming convention [sep-number; new seps should use "sep-9999"]-[sep description], e.g., ``sep-1701-prime-directive-exceptions``
3. Add a clear and succinct commit message. Extended description is optional, but encouraged, e.g.:
     "Added distress calls to prime directive exceptions
     
     A society that sent a general distress call to any
     space-faring culture could be exempt from
     Starfleet's General Order 1 (a.k.a., prime
     directive), 'No starship may interfere with the
     normal development of any alien life or society.'"
